I asked ChatGPT to give me an image of the homepage of an example site.
I tried my best to achieve visually accurate version of the image.

<img width="1024" height="1536" alt="ChatGPT Image Jul 13, 2025, 01_00_35 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44d5d967-a5bf-4b9b-99e2-93e93590655c" />

Though my code's output is visually similar, it can definitely be improved further.
